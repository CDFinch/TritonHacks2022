# TritonHacks2022 Project - Fish Simulation

## Description
We coded a fish simulation game where there are three types of fish: Goldfish, Tropical Fish, and Sharks. The game initally starts with 10 goldfish, 3 tropical fish, and 1 shark. When the same type of fish collide with each other (ie: goldfish with goldfish), they make a baby and create a new fish of their own type. When the tropical fish collides with a goldfish, the tropical fish "eats" the goldfish and the goldfish dissapears. When the shark collides with smaller fish, the shark also eats that fish. 

The population count of each type of fish is displayed in the UI screen to the right. The amount of fish that the tropical fish and sharks have killed is also displayed. 

The fish are coded to move randomly and switch directions at random times.  

The player can also interfere with the game and decide to spawn certain fish whenever they want by pressing buttons. Press the type of fish you want to spawn, and then press the "spawn" button. 

## Code and Format

This game was coded in the Java Language in the Eclipse IDE, although any IDE can run the project as long as it can handle Java. 

The resolution size of the UI interface is 1520 X 720 pixels. 

Many different Java Libraries weee used, including Random, Color, ArrayList, Timer, Graphic, Graphic 2D, ActionEvent, KeyEvent, and many more.
